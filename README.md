Duuuude, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, and wow, like, what even was that ending?! 😵 I mean, I was hyped for some killer sea adventures, but half the time I was like—why is there more singing than slashing? The sirens were kinda... not what I expected? Am I the only one who thought their voices were more annoying than mysterious? 😂

At first, I was all into it, trying to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   legally and all. You know how it is, sometimes you just gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . But, man, Geralt was on some next-level chill vibes this time around. And can we talk about Jaskier getting all the good lines? It's like the dude said one thing, and we're supposed to laugh, but I'm sitting here, stone-faced like, Uhhh, try again, bard.

> Honestly, that scene where Yen just walks out the ocean had me rollin'. All that for a drop of water surprise—didn't see that coming! Her whole sea-witch getup was cooler than anything else goin’ down. I’m just tryna wrap my head around the fact that Triss wasn’t even mentioned. Hello? Like, do these writers remember she exists?

Plus, the whole subplot with that underwater temple? Kinda felt like they were reaching for something epic, but nahhh. Half expected Batman to show up or something, you know what I mean? God, my brain hurts from trying to keep up.

Argh, then there was this random new character who just shows up, makes trouble, and dips LIKE WHY. Filler much? But, the vibe of the show was still magical somehow, and now I can't stop humming that stupid siren song. Curse catchy tunes. 🤦

Anyway, my brain is fried. Half tired, half wired from all that binge-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. Let's catch up soon, yeah? ✌️
